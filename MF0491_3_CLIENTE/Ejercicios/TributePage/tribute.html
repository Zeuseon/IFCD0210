      <h2>Career</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
         In 1991, he purchased the Intel 80386-based IBM
          PC and obtained a MINIX operating system. With this, he began to work
          and research on the Linux operating system.
        </li>

        <li>
           In 1996, he went on a visit to the technology
          firm, ‘Transmeta’, where he began to work from the following year. He
          later worked for the Open Source Development Labs.
        </li>

        <li>
           From 1997 to 1999, he worked on the '86open'
          project, which is a binary file format for the ‘Unix’ and Unix-like
          operating systems. They were to be used on a common x86 PC.
        </li>

        <li>
         In 1999, he was offered stock options for his
          creation by the companies, Red Hat and VA Linux. That very year, the
          stock prices increased to about $20 million after the companies went
          public.
        </li>

        <li>
           In June 2004, along with his family, he
          relocated to Beaverton, Oregon, where Open Source Development Labs was
          headquartered. The following year, he developed the software, ‘Git’.
        </li>

        <li>
         By 2006, about two per cent of the Linux kernel
          was written by him, which was a significant contribution.
        </li>

        <li>
         In 2012, he stated that his contribution to the
          Linux kernel mostly involved merging codes that were already written
          by others and did not involve much programming.
        </li>
